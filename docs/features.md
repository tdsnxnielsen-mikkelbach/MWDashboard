# Features

All charts include axis labels (Y-axis: metric name, X-axis: time/category) and bottom-positioned legends identifying each data series. Chart text (legends, axis labels, titles) automatically adapts to dark/light mode via MudBlazor CSS variables. All pages show a full-page loading state with spinner while loading data (on initial load and when the tenant filter changes).

## Authentication & Access Control

- **Azure AD OpenID Connect** — all dashboard pages require authentication (authorization code flow)
- **Multi-tenant sign-in** — users from the home tenant (where the app registration lives) and any active customer tenant can sign in
- **Automatic tenant validation** — on sign-in, the user's tenant ID is checked against the database; only active (consented) tenants are allowed
- **Immediate access control** — deactivating or removing a tenant immediately blocks login for users from that tenant; adding/activating allows login
- **Access denied page** — rejected tenants see a styled "Access Denied" page (`/access-denied`) with user-friendly message ("Your organization is not authorized...") and "Sign Out & Try Another Account" link; internal OIDC errors are never exposed to users
- **Data isolation** — customer-tenant users can only view data from their own tenant; queries always filter by scoped tenant ID (never fetches all data)
- **Page-level restrictions** — Tenants management (`/tenants`) and Settings (`/settings`) pages are only accessible to home-tenant users; nav links are hidden for customer-tenant users, and direct URL access silently redirects them to the dashboard (the restricted pages are never revealed)
- **AppBar user controls** — user icon (tooltip shows name) + sign-out button visible when authenticated
- **Login redirect** — unauthenticated users are automatically redirected to Azure AD sign-in (HTTP-level enforcement before Blazor renders)
- **Container Apps TLS** — forwarded headers middleware trusts proxy `X-Forwarded-Proto` to ensure `https://` redirect URIs

## Global Tenant Selector

- **Persistent tenant filter** in the AppBar — visible only for home-tenant users (admins/MSPs)
- **Customer-tenant users** see their tenant name displayed in the AppBar (no selector — data is pre-scoped)
- Select individual tenants, all, or none via dropdown menu with checkboxes
- **Disabled during data load** — shows a spinner and prevents interaction while pages are fetching data
- **Multi-tenant attribution** — when multiple tenants are selected, all charts show series labeled `"Service (TenantName)"` and all tables include a Tenant column so data origin is always clear
- **Single-tenant mode** — when only one tenant is selected, labels stay clean without redundant tenant names
- Selector immediately reflects tenant activation/deactivation/deletion — deactivated tenants are removed from both the list and current selection in real-time
- Newly reactivated tenants are auto-selected

## Dashboard (`/`)

- **Export All Data** — "Export All Data" button downloads every dashboard dataset as a single ZIP (`/api/export-all`), one CSV per dataset (24 files). Tenant scope is enforced server-side: home-tenant admins get all tenants, customer-tenant users get only their own tenant
- **KPI cards** showing total active users, Teams/Exchange/SharePoint/OneDrive counts — each card displays active users vs total licensed seats with a color-coded progress bar (green ≥70%, yellow ≥40%, red <40% adoption)
- **Active Users by Service** — shows per-service active users vs **service-relevant** license seats (only counts SKUs that include that service, not all tenant licenses). Uses dynamic `IncludedServices` field auto-detected from Graph API service plans, with static `ServiceSkuMap` fallback for older data
- 12-month MAU trend line chart (per-tenant series in multi-tenant view)
- Per-service bar chart comparison (grouped by tenant when multi-tenant)
- License utilization table (with Tenant column in multi-tenant view) — Usage column shows a progress bar alongside the utilization percentage

## Services (`/services`)

- Per-service sparkline cards with aggregated user counts across selected tenants
- Combined multi-service comparison line chart (per-tenant series in multi-tenant view)

## Licenses & Adoption (`/licenses`)

- **Date range picker** — filter all charts and data by custom time period, with **Reset** button to restore full available range
- **Data availability indicator** — shows the actual historical data range from Graph reports (uses `ReportDate`, not collection timestamp); data accumulates beyond the 180-day Graph API limit
- **Month-over-month adoption chart** — per-service active users as % of total licenses, adapts to selected date range, Y-axis 0–100% with 2 decimal places. Chart automatically re-renders when date range changes via `@key` forcing component recreation
- **Automated recommendations** — scale up/down/monitor based on utilization thresholds and trend analysis
- **License detail table** — searchable with utilization bars and recommendation chips
- **M365 Message Center** — displays service announcements and advisories with:
  - **Multi-select filter chips** for Category and Severity (toggle on/off to combine filters)
  - **Collapsible month groups** (yyyy-MM) via expansion panels — individually expand/collapse for easy scanning of large post volumes
  - Tenant column visible in multi-tenant view
  - Inline severity color coding and "no matches" feedback
- **Subscription Renewals & Expiry** — KPI cards for active subscriptions, those expiring within 30 days, and trials, plus a per-subscription table showing SKU, status, seat count, next lifecycle (renewal/expiry) date and days remaining (color-coded by urgency). Surfaces upcoming commercial renewals without any Partner Center / billing integration. Data source: Microsoft Graph `GET /directory/subscriptions` (`nextLifecycleDateTime` / `status` / `isTrial`); requires `Directory.Read.All`. `SubscriptionSnapshot`, refreshed each collection run
- **License Assignment Issues** — per-SKU license assignment errors (`licenseAssignmentStates.state == Error`, e.g. dependency/conflict) and seat waste (disabled accounts still holding a license), with KPI cards for seats-in-error and disabled-but-licensed plus a per-SKU table. A reseller-specific "you are paying for N seats that aren't actually applied" deliverable. Shows a green confirmation when clean. Data source: Microsoft Graph `GET /users` (`accountEnabled` + `licenseAssignmentStates`); requires `User.Read.All` (already granted; all tiers). `LicenseAssignmentIssueSnapshot`, delete-then-insert per tenant per day

## Feature-Level Activity (`/activity`)

- **Per-workload feature breakdown** — Teams (meetings, chat messages, channel messages, calls), Exchange (emails sent/received/read), SharePoint (files viewed, files shared, page views, files synced), OneDrive (files viewed, files shared, files synced)
- **30-day activity trend charts** — one chart per workload with line series per activity type; in multi-tenant view, series are labeled `"ActivityType (TenantName)"` for per-tenant granularity
- **Activity summary table** — searchable, sortable by total count and daily average across all workloads
- Multi-tenant support — Tenant column visible when multiple tenants are selected; charts show tenant-level breakdown
- Data source: Graph Reports API (`getTeamsUserActivityCounts`, `getSharePointActivityUserCounts`, `getOneDriveActivityUserCounts`, `getEmailActivityCounts`)
- **Top Teams by Activity** — a top-20 table of the most active teams (by active users, then message volume) showing team name, type, active users, active channels, guests, channel messages, reply messages, meetings organized and last activity date (Tenant column in multi-tenant view). Helps spot the busiest collaboration spaces and ownerless/abandoned teams. Data source: Graph Reports API `getTeamsTeamActivityDetail` (`Reports.Read.All`). `TeamsTeamActivitySnapshot`, top-20 rows per tenant per day

## M365 App Usage (`/m365apps`)

- **Users by Application** — bar chart of active user counts per app (Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Teams)
- **Users by Platform** — donut chart of active users by platform (Windows, Mac, Mobile, Web); in multi-tenant view it switches to a grouped bar chart with one series per tenant
- **App usage details table** — searchable/sortable per-app user counts with report date; Tenant column in multi-tenant view. In multi-tenant view the table is grouped into expandable sections by tenant (initially expanded) for easier scanning across tenants
- **All apps always shown** — every app column present in the report is recorded even when its count is 0 or blank, so apps with no recent activity (e.g. PowerPoint) still appear with a 0 value rather than silently disappearing
- **App × Platform Adoption matrix** — per-application active-user counts split by platform (Windows / Mac / Mobile / Web), derived from the per-user detail report (`getM365AppUserDetail`). Aggregated to counts only — **user identities are anonymized** with irreversible, per-tenant pseudonyms (no UPNs or display names are ever stored). In multi-tenant view a Tenant column is added and rows are listed per tenant
- **Office Desktop Activations by Product & Device** — grouped bar chart of Office desktop install/activation counts per product (e.g. Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise) across devices (Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, Windows Mobile), from `getOffice365ActivationCounts`; backed by anonymized per-user activation detail (`getOffice365ActivationsUserDetail`). In multi-tenant view categories are split per tenant (`Tenant · Product`) so each tenant's activations are distinguishable
- Data source: Graph Reports API (`getM365AppUserCounts` + `getM365AppPlatformUserCounts` + `getM365AppUserDetail` with D30 period; `getOffice365ActivationCounts` + `getOffice365ActivationsUserDetail` have no period parameter); usage data lags ~2–3 days and depends on tenant telemetry/diagnostic-data settings

## Copilot Adoption (`/copilot`)

- **KPI cards** — Total Copilot active users, total assigned licenses, overall adoption rate with color-coded thresholds
- **Per-app bar chart** — Active users across Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, OneNote, Loop, and Copilot Chat
- **Adoption detail table** — per-app breakdown with utilization progress bars and status chips (Strong/Growing/Low/Critical)
- **Copilot licenses by tenant** — per-tenant table of assigned vs. total Copilot SKU seats (SKU part number contains `COPILOT`); shown even when no usage data is returned, so tenants that hold Copilot licenses but have no reported activity (or only use free Copilot Chat) still surface their license footprint
- **Automated recommendations** — actionable alerts based on adoption patterns (low app usage, overall low adoption, Chat-only usage patterns)
- Multi-tenant view — per-tenant grouped bar chart series
- Data source: Graph Beta API (`getMicrosoft365CopilotUsageUserDetail`); requires <PermissionTag Scope="Reports.Read.All" /> and **returns usage only for users holding a Microsoft 365 Copilot license**. Free, unlicensed **Copilot Chat** usage is *not* exposed by Graph — it is collected separately (see the Copilot Chat section below). The empty-state message explains this and still lists Copilot license counts when present

### Copilot Chat (unlicensed)

- **Dedicated section** on the same `/copilot` page covering free **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat** usage by unlicensed users (BizChat, Bing, Edge, Office, M365 App surfaces) — the data the Graph reports API does not return
- **KPI cards** — unlicensed chat users and active chat users for the latest day (per surface), total interactions over 30 days, and active-surface count
- **Daily activity trend chart** — interactions, active users, and unlicensed users per day (ApexChart, guarded against empty series)
- **Per-surface table** — latest-day active users, unlicensed users, and interactions broken down by `AppHost`
- **"Poll Copilot Chat" button** — triggers on-demand collection for the selected tenant(s) via the dedicated `MWDashboard.CopilotAudit` container app (HTTP call with local fallback), then reloads
- **Resilience messaging** — when no data has been collected yet, a clear info message explains the three expected causes: up to 12 h initial audit latency, unified audit logging being disabled, or no Copilot Chat usage in the 7-day audit-retention window
- **Poll severity** — expected tenant-configuration states (audit backend not provisioned, unified audit logging disabled, subscription not yet enabled, or admin consent missing) surface as a **warning** snackbar ("Copilot Chat not yet available for '…'"), not an error — these are admin actions on the customer tenant, not system faults. Only genuine, unexpected failures show as an error. This is driven by a dedicated `CopilotAuditConfigurationException` thrown by `ManagementActivityClient` for recognized Management Activity API responses (AF20022/AF20023/AF20055, "tenant does not exist", and auth/consent failures); long stack traces are stripped from the message before it reaches the UI
- Data source: **Office 365 Management Activity API** (`Audit.General` `CopilotInteraction` events), collected by `MWDashboard.CopilotAudit` and stored as `CopilotChatUsageSnapshot`; requires <PermissionTag Scope="ActivityFeed.Read" /> (Office 365 Management APIs) and unified audit logging enabled per tenant. Unlicensed users are derived by cross-referencing interacting users against assigned Copilot SKUs

## User Segmentation (`/segmentation`)

- **Segment KPIs** — Total users, Heavy (3+ active workloads), Light (1–2 workloads), Inactive (0 workloads) with percentages
- **Distribution chart** — Donut chart in single-tenant view; switches to grouped bar chart (one series per tenant) in multi-tenant view showing Heavy/Light/Inactive side by side
- **Segment trend** — Stacked area chart tracking segment sizes over time (up to 6 months); in multi-tenant view, series are labeled per-tenant (e.g., "Heavy (Contoso)", "Inactive (Fabrikam)") for independent tracking
- **Per-tenant breakdown table** — shows waste % (inactive/total) per tenant in multi-tenant view
- **Recommendations** — license waste alerts for high inactive %, adoption maturity recognition, light-user campaign suggestions
- Data source: Graph Reports API (`getOffice365ActiveUserDetail` with D30 period); user detail is aggregated into counts, no PII stored

## Department Adoption (`/departments`)

- **KPI cards** — Departments tracked, average adoption rate, lowest-adoption department
- **Horizontal stacked bar chart** — Active vs. inactive users per department (top 20 by size)
- **Department detail table** — searchable, with adoption progress bars and status chips (High/Medium/Low)
- Multi-tenant support — Tenant column in table when multiple tenants selected
- **Minimum threshold** — departments with fewer than 5 users excluded from "lowest adoption" KPI to avoid noise
- Data source: Graph API `/users` (department field) + `getOffice365ActiveUserDetail`; requires `User.Read.All` permission

## Consumption Proxy (`/consumption`)

- **Composite consumption score** (0–100) — weighted from 4 dimensions:
  - Active User Adoption (30%) — MAU / licensed seats
  - Activity Intensity (30%) — total actions (emails, meetings, files) / active users
  - Storage Utilization (20%) — used storage / estimated allocation
  - Workload Breadth (20%) — avg services used per user (from segmentation)
- **KPI cards with month-over-month deltas** — Overall score, adoption %, total storage, avg workloads; each shows a color-coded chip indicating change vs previous month (+green / -red)
- **Export CSV** — "Export CSV" button downloads all consumption data as `/api/export/consumption` (TenantId, Score, Adoption, Storage, Workloads, Activity); tenant scope enforced server-side from the signed-in user's claims
- **Per-tenant score comparison** — horizontal progress bars ranked by score
- **Radar chart** — 4-axis breakdown (Adoption, Activity, Storage, Breadth) per tenant
- **Score trend** — line chart tracking consumption score over time (up to 6 months); per-tenant series in multi-tenant view
- **Storage by service** — breakdown of SharePoint, OneDrive, Exchange storage with bars
- **Recommendations** — actionable alerts for low scores, license waste, narrow workload usage
- Data source: Computed from `getSharePointSiteUsageStorage`, `getOneDriveUsageStorage`, `getMailboxUsageStorage` + existing MAU/activity/segmentation data

## Security Services (`/security`)

- **Tenant Entra ID License Levels table** — auto-detects P1/P2/Free tier from stored license SKUs per tenant, shows which tenants can provide sign-in and MFA data
- **Tenant-scoped** — Entra ID tier table and sign-in data filtered to selected/scoped tenants (customer-tenant users see only their own tenant)
- **Sign-in activity chart** (30 days) — success vs failure area chart with axis labels and legend
- **Per-service breakdown** — Defender, Entra ID, Intune, Sentinel cards with failure rates
- **MFA adoption rate** — gauge with percentage and actionable recommendations
- **True MFA data** — uses Microsoft Graph Beta API `AuthenticationDetails` (counts non-password auth methods that succeeded). Only available from tenants with Entra ID P1/P2
- **MFA & Authentication Method Registration** — tenant-wide registration gauges for member accounts (guests excluded): MFA registered, MFA capable, passwordless capable, SSPR registered (with raw counts). Available on **all tiers** via `AuditLog.Read.All` — does not require P1/P2. Data source: Microsoft Graph `GET /reports/authenticationMethods/userRegistrationDetails`
- **Inactive / Stale Licensed Accounts** — KPI cards for enabled, licensed member accounts: total licensed, inactive 30+ days, inactive 90+ days, never signed in (each with % of licensed). Surfaces license-reclamation opportunities. **Requires Microsoft Entra ID P1/P2** — the underlying `signInActivity` property is premium-gated and returns 403 on the free tier even when `AuditLog.Read.All` + `User.Read.All` are consented. The dashboard detects the tenant tier from its SKUs and **skips this collection entirely on free-tier tenants** (logged at Information, not as a permission error). Data source: Microsoft Graph `GET /users` with `signInActivity`
- **Legacy Auth & Risky Sign-ins** (last 30 days) — KPI cards for legacy-auth sign-ins (POP/IMAP/SMTP and other clients that bypass modern auth & MFA), failed sign-ins, risky sign-ins (Identity Protection low/medium/high), and distinct sign-in countries, plus a **by-client-app** table (Legacy/Modern chip + success/failure/risky counts) and a **top-15 sign-in-by-country** table. **Requires Microsoft Entra ID P1/P2** — sign-in logs are premium-gated (collected inside the same tier-gated block as the sign-in summary; `IsPremiumLicenseError` distinguishes a free-tier 403 from a consent gap). **History is accumulated in-DB beyond the tenant's ~30-day sign-in-log retention** via a per-tenant cursor (`SignInDetailCursorUtc`) + ADD-on-upsert. No per-user identities are stored (aggregate counts only). Data source: Microsoft Graph beta `GET /auditLogs/signIns` (`clientAppUsed`, `status`, `location.countryOrRegion`, `riskLevelAggregated`); requires `AuditLog.Read.All` (already granted). `SignInDetailSnapshot`, one row per (client app, country) per tenant per day
- **Microsoft Defender Alerts** (last 30 days) — KPI cards for total alerts, high/critical, active (new + in-progress), and resolved, plus a severity/status breakdown table (color-coded severity chips; Tenant column in multi-tenant view). Requires a Microsoft Defender / Defender XDR subscription on the tenant. Data source: Microsoft Graph `GET /security/alerts_v2` (aggregated by severity + status); requires `SecurityAlert.Read.All` (**new permission** — must be re-consented). `DefenderAlertSnapshot`, one row per (severity, status) per tenant per day
- **External Sharing Activity** (last 30 days) — KPI cards for anonymous-link, external/guest, and organization shares, plus a per-day share-type table (event count + distinct users). Sourced from the **Office 365 Management Activity API** `Audit.SharePoint` feed (not Graph) via the same `ActivityFeed.Read` permission already used for unlicensed Copilot Chat — collected by the `MWDashboard.CopilotAudit` container. Requires unified audit logging enabled on the tenant. `ExternalSharingSnapshot`, one row per (share type) per tenant per day
- **Suspicious Mailbox Rules** (last 30 days) — KPI cards for auto-forwarding, redirect, and auto-delete inbox rules plus a per-day rule-type table (event count + distinct mailboxes) — a key business-email-compromise (BEC) indicator. Shows a green "no suspicious rules detected" confirmation when empty. Sourced from the **Office 365 Management Activity API** `Audit.Exchange` feed (`New-InboxRule` / `Set-InboxRule` / `Set-Mailbox` with forwarding/redirect/delete parameters) via `ActivityFeed.Read` — collected by the `MWDashboard.CopilotAudit` container. `MailRuleEventSnapshot`, one row per (rule type) per tenant per day
- **Mailbox Access** (last 30 days) — KPI cards for non-owner mailbox access and delegate-permission grants plus a per-day table (event count + distinct mailboxes) — an insider-risk / compromised-delegate indicator that pairs with Suspicious Mailbox Rules. Shows a green confirmation when empty. Sourced from the **same `Audit.Exchange` blob loop** (`MailItemsAccessed` / `MessageBind` / `FolderBind` with non-owner `LogonType`, and `Add-MailboxPermission`) via `ActivityFeed.Read` — **no extra API calls**. `MailboxAccessSnapshot`, one row per (access type) per tenant per day
- **DLP Policy Matches** (last 30 days) — KPI cards for total matches, high-severity matches, and distinct policies triggered, plus a per-policy table (severity + match count) surfacing Microsoft Purview DLP sensitive-data exposure events. **Informs the operator when the tenant is not running Purview DLP** (an info alert is shown instead of an empty table). Sourced from the **Office 365 Management Activity API** `DLP.All` feed via `ActivityFeed.Read` — collected by the `MWDashboard.CopilotAudit` container. `DlpEventSnapshot`, one row per (policy) per tenant per day
- **Change Log — Directory Audit** (last 30 days) — admin & directory change events (role grants, user/group create-delete, app consents, password resets, policy/license changes) aggregated by category + activity per day, with KPI cards for total changes, failed operations, and distinct categories. Actor identities are pseudonymized (only distinct-actor counts are stored). The strongest **QBR accountability** deliverable. **History is accumulated in-DB beyond the tenant's native retention** (Entra free tier keeps only ~7 days, P1/P2 ~30 days) — a per-tenant cursor + ADD-on-upsert means each daily collection appends new events, and the empty-state surfaces the retention caveat (same pattern as the Copilot audit section). In multi-tenant view the table is **grouped by tenant with collapsible groups** (each group header shows the tenant's total events/failures). Data source: Microsoft Graph `GET /auditLogs/directoryAudits`; requires `AuditLog.Read.All` (already granted; all tiers). `DirectoryAuditSnapshot`
- **Clear data availability notes** — explains exactly what's available per license tier and that Free-tier tenants cannot expose sign-in/audit-derived data via Graph

## Secure Score (`/securescore`)

- **KPI cards** — current secure score % (points achieved / max), delta vs. global average benchmark, count of actions to improve, licensed/active users. The licensed-users count falls back to the tenant's consumed license seats when Microsoft Graph reports a stale/zero `licensedUserCount`, and is never shown lower than the active-user count
- **Score trend chart** — secure score % over the last 90 days; per-tenant series in multi-tenant view
- **Score by category** — donut chart of achieved points per control category (Identity, Data, Device, Apps, Infrastructure)
- **Recommended remediation actions** — searchable/sortable table of controls not fully implemented, ordered by lowest progress first, with progress bar, category, and implementation status (Complete/Partial/Not started); Tenant column in multi-tenant view
- **Collapsible grouping** — "Group by" selector groups remediation actions into expandable/collapsible sections by Category, Tenant, or Tenant → Category (nested). Defaults to Tenant → Category in multi-tenant view and Category in single-tenant view; tenant-based modes auto-fall back to Category when a single tenant is selected. Each group header shows an action count for quick scanning across many tenants
- **Tenant-scoped** — customer-tenant users see only their own tenant's score
- Data source: Microsoft Graph `GET /security/secureScores` (90-day trend + embedded control scores); requires `SecurityEvents.Read.All`

## Service Health (`/servicehealth`)

- **KPI cards** — services healthy (of total monitored), services affected (degraded/interrupted), active incidents, active advisories
- **Active service issues** — searchable/sortable table of unresolved incidents and advisories with service, type (Incident/Advisory), status, feature, and start time; Tenant column in multi-tenant view. **Collapsible grouping** via a "Group by" selector: None, Service, Type (incident/advisory), Tenant, or Tenant → Service (nested). Defaults to Tenant in multi-tenant view, Service in single-tenant view
- **Service status overview** — per-service operational status with color-coded icon (operational/degraded/interrupted), affected services sorted to the top. **Collapsible grouping** via a "Group by" selector: None, Status, Tenant, or Tenant → Status (nested). Defaults to Tenant in multi-tenant view. Group headers show a service count
- **Tenant-scoped** — customer-tenant users see only their own tenant's service health
- Data source: Microsoft Graph `GET /admin/serviceAnnouncement/healthOverviews` (per-service status) + `GET /admin/serviceAnnouncement/issues` (active issues); requires `ServiceHealth.Read.All`

## Identity & Devices (`/identity`)

A single page with nine tabs covering endpoint and identity governance. Each tab degrades gracefully with an info alert when its data/permission is unavailable, shows KPI cards plus charts, and adds a per-tenant comparison table in multi-tenant view.

- **Device Compliance** — Intune-managed device posture: managed device count, compliant %, non-compliant count, in-grace/error count; compliance-status donut and devices-by-platform bar chart. Data source: `GET /deviceManagement/managedDevices`; requires `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All` (available on all tiers)
- **Patch / OS Versions** — patch-hygiene view derived from the **same** `managedDevices` list as Device Compliance (**no extra Graph call**): managed-device count, up-to-date check-in %, stale-device count (no Intune sync for 30+ days), distinct-OS-build count; top-OS-versions bar chart, a **stale-device trend line (90 days)** built from the retained daily history, and a per-platform×version breakdown table (collapsible per-tenant groups in multi-tenant view) with stale-device chips. Data source: `GET /deviceManagement/managedDevices` (`osVersion` + `lastSyncDateTime`); requires `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All` (all tiers)
- **Stale Registered Devices** — Entra-registered/joined device hygiene (distinct from Intune compliance — covers **all** registered devices, not just managed ones): registered-device count, stale count (no sign-in for 90+ days), disabled-device count, stale-share %; registered-by-platform and stale-by-platform bar charts plus a per-platform breakdown table (collapsible per-tenant groups in multi-tenant view) with stale/disabled chips. Data source: `GET /devices` (`operatingSystem` + `approximateLastSignInDateTime` + `accountEnabled`); reuses the already-granted `Directory.Read.All` (all tiers). `StaleDeviceSnapshot`, delete-then-insert per tenant per day
- **Conditional Access** — policy inventory and coverage gaps: total/enabled/report-only policy counts, MFA-enforced indicator, legacy-auth-blocked indicator (aggregated across tenants); policy-state donut and per-tenant coverage table with MFA/legacy-block icons (icon legend + per-icon tooltips explain enforced vs. coverage-gap states). Data source: `GET /identity/conditionalAccess/policies`; requires `Policy.Read.All` **and Entra ID P1/P2** — Conditional Access is a premium feature, so Free-tier tenants have no policies to report
- **Guest Users** — external-collaboration governance: total guests, accepted vs. pending-acceptance, recently-added (last 30 days); invitation-status donut. Data source: `GET /users?$filter=userType eq 'Guest'`; reuses the already-granted `User.Read.All` (all tiers)
- **Risky Users** — Identity Protection risk: at-risk users by High/Medium/Low risk level; risk-level donut. Data source: `GET /identityProtection/riskyUsers`; requires `IdentityRiskyUser.Read.All` **and Entra ID P2** — tenants below P2 are skipped during collection (logged at Information)
- **App Credential Expiry** — app-registration secret/certificate hygiene: total credentials, expired count, expiring ≤ 30 days, expiring ≤ 90 days; full table with red/amber/green status chips sorted by days-to-expiry (Tenant column in multi-tenant view). Surfaces credentials that will silently break integrations before they lapse. Data source: `GET /applications` (`passwordCredentials` + `keyCredentials`); requires `Application.Read.All` (**new permission** — must be re-consented; all tiers)
- **Privileged Roles** — standing directory-role membership: active role count, Global Administrator count (warns above 5), total privileged members, high-impact role count; role-membership table with sensitivity chips. Helps enforce least-privilege / Global Admin ≤ 4 best practice. Data source: `GET /directoryRoles` with members; requires `RoleManagement.Read.Directory` (**new permission** — must be re-consented; all tiers). PIM eligible-assignment depth is deferred
- **OAuth Apps** — third-party app consent / illicit-consent attack surface: consented-app count, high-risk-app count (apps holding sensitive scopes such as `Mail.Read`, `Files.ReadWrite.All`, `Directory.ReadWrite.All`), admin-consented (tenant-wide) grant count, total delegated scopes; per-app table with high-risk-scope chips and admin-vs-user consent badges. Data source: Microsoft Graph `GET /oauth2PermissionGrants` + `GET /servicePrincipals`; requires `Application.Read.All` + `Directory.Read.All` (already granted; all tiers). Delegated grants only — application app-role grants are a future enhancement. `OAuthGrantSnapshot`, delete-then-insert per tenant per day
- **Tenant-scoped** — customer-tenant users see only their own tenant's data
- Data models: `DeviceComplianceSnapshot`, `DevicePatchSnapshot`, `StaleDeviceSnapshot`, `ConditionalAccessSnapshot`, `GuestUserSnapshot`, `RiskyUserSnapshot`, `AppCredentialSnapshot`, `PrivilegedRoleSnapshot`, `OAuthGrantSnapshot` (one row per tenant per day; device patch/stale devices/app credentials/privileged roles/OAuth grants delete-then-insert per tenant per day)

## Threat Protection (`/threat-protection`)

A single page with two tabs surfacing Microsoft Defender for Office 365 outcomes. Each tab degrades gracefully with an info alert when its data/license is unavailable; the page-level empty state lists any selected tenants that are **not licensed** for Defender for Office 365. Defender capability is shown as a separate chip (MDO P1 / MDO P2 / Not licensed) on the Tenants page, derived from licenses via `TenantDefenderTier` (not via the consent mechanism).

- **Email Threats** (last 30 days) — phishing / malware / spam threats **blocked** by EOP/MDO (the "we stopped X threats this month" QBR headline): total blocked, malware, phishing, spam/other KPI cards; threats-by-type donut + blocked-by-type bar; per-threat-type detail table (collapsible per-tenant groups in multi-tenant view) with color-coded threat chips. Data source: Microsoft Graph `GET /security/alerts_v2` filtered to email-threat categories; reuses the already-granted `SecurityAlert.Read.All`. **Requires a Defender for Office 365 / EOP plan** (MDO P1 or P2) — gated via `TenantDefenderTier`; no-ops gracefully on 403. `DeliveredCount` is not available via app-only Graph today, so it stays 0. `EmailThreatSnapshot`, delete-then-insert per tenant per day
- **Attack Simulation Training** — security-awareness posture from phishing-simulation campaigns: campaign count, average compromised rate, users-clicked vs. users-reported KPI cards; compromised-rate-by-campaign bar and a campaign-detail table (targeted → clicked → reported funnel with compromised-rate chips; collapsible per-tenant groups in multi-tenant view). Data source: `GET /security/attackSimulation/simulations` + each campaign's `report` (via `$expand=report`); requires `AttackSimulation.Read.All` (**new permission**) **and Defender for Office 365 Plan 2** — `AttackSimulation.Read.All` is intentionally excluded from the consent probe (its 403 on a non-P2 tenant is a licensing limit, not a consent gap), gated via `TenantDefenderTier.HasAttackSimulation`; no-ops gracefully on 403. No per-user PII (campaign-level counts only). `AttackSimSnapshot`, delete-then-insert per tenant per day
- **Tenant-scoped** — customer-tenant users see only their own tenant's data
- Data models: `EmailThreatSnapshot`, `AttackSimSnapshot`

## Usage & Governance (`/usage`)

A single page with five tabs covering workload adoption and Microsoft 365 governance hygiene. Each tab degrades gracefully with an info alert when its data/permission is unavailable, shows KPI cards plus charts, and adds top-N drill-down tables (with a Tenant column in multi-tenant view).

- **Mailbox Usage** — Exchange Online mailbox posture: total/active mailboxes, total storage used, at/over-quota count (warning + send-prohibited); quota-status and active-vs-inactive donuts; top-20 largest mailboxes table (storage, item count, last activity — grouped by tenant in multi-tenant view). Data sources: `getMailboxUsageDetail`, `getMailboxUsageQuotaStatusMailboxCounts`; requires `Reports.Read.All` (all tiers)
- **Teams Devices** — Teams client adoption: desktop / mobile / web user counts, total active users; users-by-device-type bar and platform-mix donut. In multi-tenant view both charts switch to per-tenant bar series (Users by Device Type = grouped, Platform Mix = stacked). Data source: `getTeamsDeviceUsageUserCounts`; requires `Reports.Read.All` (all tiers)
- **SharePoint & OneDrive** — collaboration storage: SharePoint site count + storage, OneDrive account count + storage, combined storage and file totals; storage-by-workload donut and site-count bar (both switch to per-tenant bar series in multi-tenant view); top-20 largest sites/accounts table. Data sources: `getSharePointSiteUsageDetail`, `getOneDriveUsageAccountDetail`; requires `Reports.Read.All` (all tiers)
- **Viva Engage** — Yammer/Viva Engage engagement: users who posted / read / liked; engagement-mix bar. Data source: `getYammerActivityUserCounts`; requires `Reports.Read.All` and an active Viva Engage deployment (all tiers)
- **Groups & Teams** — group governance: total groups, Microsoft 365 groups, Teams-connected groups, ownerless M365 groups (governance-risk warning when > 0); groups-by-type donut (Microsoft 365 / Security / Distribution Lists / Other — switches to per-tenant bar series in multi-tenant view) and per-tenant table. Group types are classified from Graph properties: Microsoft 365 = `groupTypes` contains `Unified`; Security = security-enabled non-unified; Distribution Lists = mail-enabled non-security non-unified; Other = any remaining edge cases. Data source: `GET /groups` with `owners` expand; requires `Group.Read.All` (**new permission** — must be re-consented by each tenant)
- **Tenant-scoped** — customer-tenant users see only their own tenant's data
- Data models: `MailboxUsageSnapshot`, `TopMailboxSnapshot`, `TeamsDeviceUsageSnapshot`, `SiteUsageSnapshot`, `SiteUsageDetailSnapshot`, `YammerActivitySnapshot`, `GroupSnapshot` (aggregates one row per tenant per day; top-N rows ranked per tenant per day)

## Data Export (CSV / ZIP)

Every dashboard dataset can be exported to CSV. Exports are served from minimal-API endpoints (`MWDashboard.Web/Endpoints/ExportEndpoints.cs`) and use the same authentication and tenant-data isolation as the UI.

- **Per-page Export CSV buttons** — single-dataset pages (Dashboard/Services, Licenses, Feature Usage, Copilot, Departments, Segmentation, M365 Apps, Consumption) show an "Export CSV" button (`ExportButton.razor`) that downloads `/api/export/{feature}`
- **Per-dataset Export menus** — multi-dataset (tabbed) pages show an "Export CSV" dropdown (`ExportMenu.razor`) with one item per dataset:
  - **Secure Score** — Score History, Control Details
  - **Service Health** — Service Status, Incidents & Advisories
  - **Identity & Devices** — Device Compliance, Patch / OS Versions, Stale Registered Devices, Conditional Access, Guest Users, Risky Users, App Credential Expiry, OAuth Apps, Privileged Roles
  - **Security** — Sign-ins & MFA, Legacy Auth & Risky Sign-ins, Defender Alerts, External Sharing, Suspicious Mailbox Rules, Mailbox Access, DLP Policy Matches, Change Log (Directory Audit)
  - **Threat Protection** — Email Threats, Attack Simulation Training
  - **M365 Apps** — App × Platform Detail (anonymized), Office Activations (counts), Office Activations (anonymized users)
  - **Usage & Governance** — Mailbox Usage, Top Mailboxes, Teams Devices, SharePoint & OneDrive, Top Sites/Accounts, Viva Engage, Groups & Teams
- **Export All Data (ZIP)** — the Dashboard page has an "Export All Data" button (`/api/export-all`) that streams a single ZIP containing every dataset as its own CSV (33 files), named `mwdashboard-export-{date}.zip`
- **Tenant isolation enforced server-side** — every export endpoint derives tenant scope from the signed-in user's `tenantid` claim (mirroring `MainLayout`): home-tenant admins export all tenants; customer-tenant users export only their own tenant. Client-supplied input is never trusted, so altering a URL cannot leak another tenant's data
- **Single source of truth** — `ExportEndpoints.cs` defines each dataset once (filename, header, row builder); both the individual `/api/export/{feature}` endpoints and the `/api/export-all` ZIP reuse those definitions. CSV fields are escaped for commas/quotes/newlines

## Branding & Appearance (`/settings`)

- **Home-tenant only** — page restricted to home-tenant users (same guard pattern as Tenants page)
- **Custom app title** — override "Modern Workplace Dashboard" text in the AppBar
- **Logo upload** — displayed in AppBar next to the title (max 512KB; PNG, JPG, SVG, WebP)
- **Favicon upload** — custom browser tab icon (max 128KB; PNG, ICO, SVG)
- **Light theme colors** — Primary, Secondary, and AppBar background color pickers
- **Dark theme colors** — Primary, Secondary, and AppBar background color pickers
- **Live preview** — branding applied on next page load (stored in DB as singleton row)
- **Reset to defaults** — one-click restore of default MudBlazor theme colors
- **Whitelabeling** — enables CSP partners to match their corporate branding across the dashboard for all users (including customer-tenant users)
- Data model: `BrandingSettings` (single row, stores Base64 images + hex colors + app title)
- **TD SYNNEX attribution (non-removable)** — a theme-aware TD SYNNEX logo is centered in the top app bar, served from static files (`wwwroot/tds-logo-light.svg` for light mode, `wwwroot/tds-logo-dark.svg` for dark mode). It is rendered **independently of `BrandingSettings`**, so customer/CSP rebranding cannot change or hide it. Per the [LICENSE](../LICENSE), this attribution must remain visible and unaltered in all deployments. It is hidden only on narrow (<960px) viewports to avoid colliding with the title/controls

## Tenant Management (`/tenants`)

- **Home-tenant only** — page restricted to home-tenant users; nav link hidden and page guarded for customer-tenant users
- Register/deregister tenants — form auto-resets after successful registration with auto-dismissing success message
- **Inline display name editing** — pencil icon next to each tenant name opens an inline text field with save/cancel buttons; updates propagate to the global tenant selector immediately
- Admin consent URL generator with clipboard copy — redirect URI points to the Static Web App consent-complete page (configured via `ConsentCallback:RedirectUri`)
- **Collect Now button** — triggers immediate data collection for a specific tenant via the dedicated Collector container app (internal HTTP call); automatically falls back to local collection if the collector is unavailable. Collects MAU, licenses, Message Center, sign-ins, activity, Copilot, segmentation, departments, storage, M365 app usage (incl. anonymized per-user app × platform detail and Office desktop activations), and consumption score. Within a single tenant the ~30 independent Graph metric calls run **concurrently** with an adaptive, bounded degree of parallelism (ceiling configurable via `Collection:MaxParallelMetricsPerTenant`, default 6) — collection self-tunes downward in response to live Graph throttling and recovers automatically (see [Adaptive Graph throttle handling](architecture.md#adaptive-graph-throttle-handling))
- **Collect All Tenants button** — runs collection across every **active** tenant **in parallel** (bounded concurrency, default 4, configurable via `Collector:MaxParallelCollections`) without clicking each row. The on-demand Collector container scales independently (0→3 replicas × 5 concurrent requests) so it absorbs the concurrent load. A live progress panel shows each tenant's status (queued → collecting → collected/failed) with a per-tenant spinner while in flight, an aggregate progress bar ("n of N done, m in progress"), and a final overall summary ("completed for all N" or "n succeeded, m failed"). UI updates from the parallel collection tasks are marshaled back onto the Blazor circuit. Disabled while any single-tenant collection is already running
- **Purge data button** — deletes all historical snapshot data for a tenant (every metric table scoped by `TenantId`) while keeping the tenant registration and consent intact, so the next collection rebuilds history from scratch. Guarded by a confirmation dialog; the row is disabled while its purge is in flight. Cache is flushed afterward so the dashboard immediately reflects the cleared data
- **Action tooltips** — the Active toggle, Delete, and Purge buttons each carry a descriptive tooltip explaining their effect (e.g. Delete removes the tenant + blocks its users' login; Purge clears history but keeps the registration)
- Toggle tenant active/inactive — global tenant selector updates immediately when toggling or deleting tenants; deactivating blocks login for that tenant's users
- **Login access tied to tenant status** — adding a tenant allows users from that tenant to sign in; removing/deactivating blocks their access immediately
- **Consent health indicator** — a per-tenant "Consent" column shows a green check when all required Graph permissions are consented, or a "Re-consent" warning chip (with tooltip listing the missing permissions) when a tenant admin needs to re-approve. A warning banner at the top of the page lists all affected tenants with direct re-consent links. Status is refreshed automatically on every data collection and on-demand via a per-row "Check permissions" button. The probe distinguishes genuine consent gaps from premium-license limitations (e.g. `signInActivity` needing P1/P2) so consented permissions are never falsely flagged
- **Entra ID plan column** — a per-tenant "Plan" chip (Free / P1 / P2) derived from the tenant's license SKUs, making it clear at a glance which tenants support sign-in-based features (inactive accounts, sign-in summary) and which don't

## Automated Consent & Tenant Registration

- **Consent Complete Page** — Static Web App (`static/consent-complete/index.html`) hosted separately from the dashboard on Azure Static Web Apps (Free tier)
- **Isolation**: Customer admins are never redirected to the actual dashboard — they see only a branded static page with no access to customer-sensitive data
- **Auto-registration flow**:
  1. Tenant admin clicks the consent URL (generated from Tenants page or sent via email)
  2. Azure AD shows the permission consent prompt
  3. On approval, Azure AD redirects to the Static Web App with `?tenant={tenantId}&admin_consent=True`
  4. The static page computes an HMAC token and POSTs to the Consent Callback container (`/consent-callback`)
  5. The Consent container validates the HMAC, calls Graph API `GET /organization` to verify consent and retrieve tenant details
  6. Auto-fills: TenantId (from URL), TenantName (*.onmicrosoft.com domain), DisplayName (organization name)
  7. Upserts `TenantInfo` with `IsActive = true`
  8. Triggers initial data collection for the newly registered tenant
  9. Returns success — static page shows "Consent granted successfully" with org details and a **"Go to Dashboard"** button linking to the web app
- **Dashboard link**: On successful consent, partner tenant users see a button to navigate directly to the dashboard and sign in with their organizational account
- **Security**: HMAC shared secret validation prevents unauthorized callback abuse; Graph API call verifies consent is actually granted
- **Telemetry**: Application Insights JS SDK tracks consent page views and success/failure rates

# Features

All charts include axis labels (Y-axis: metric name, X-axis: time/category) and bottom-positioned legends identifying each data series. Chart text (legends, axis labels, titles) automatically adapts to dark/light mode via MudBlazor CSS variables. All pages show a full-page loading state with spinner while loading data (on initial load and when the tenant filter changes).

## Authentication & Access Control

- **Azure AD OpenID Connect** — all dashboard pages require authentication
- **Multi-tenant sign-in** — users from the home tenant (where the app registration lives) and any consented customer tenant can sign in
- **Automatic tenant validation** — on sign-in, the user's tenant ID is checked against the database; only active (consented) tenants are allowed
- **Data isolation** — customer-tenant users can only view data from their own tenant; home-tenant users see all registered tenants
- **AppBar user controls** — user icon (tooltip shows name) + sign-out button visible when authenticated
- **Login redirect** — unauthenticated users are automatically redirected to Azure AD sign-in

## Global Tenant Selector

- **Persistent tenant filter** in the AppBar — visible only for home-tenant users (admins/MSPs)
- **Customer-tenant users** see their tenant name displayed in the AppBar (no selector — data is pre-scoped)
- Select individual tenants, all, or none via dropdown menu with checkboxes
- **Disabled during data load** — shows a spinner and prevents interaction while pages are fetching data
- **Multi-tenant attribution** — when multiple tenants are selected, all charts show series labeled `"Service (TenantName)"` and all tables include a Tenant column so data origin is always clear
- **Single-tenant mode** — when only one tenant is selected, labels stay clean without redundant tenant names
- Selector immediately reflects tenant activation/deactivation/deletion — deactivated tenants are removed from both the list and current selection in real-time
- Newly reactivated tenants are auto-selected

## Dashboard (`/`)

- **KPI cards** showing total active users, Teams/Exchange/SharePoint/OneDrive counts — each card displays active users vs total licensed seats with a color-coded progress bar (green ≥70%, yellow ≥40%, red <40% adoption)
- **Active Users by Service** — shows per-service active users vs **service-relevant** license seats (only counts SKUs that include that service, not all tenant licenses). Uses dynamic `IncludedServices` field auto-detected from Graph API service plans, with static `ServiceSkuMap` fallback for older data
- 12-month MAU trend line chart (per-tenant series in multi-tenant view)
- Per-service bar chart comparison (grouped by tenant when multi-tenant)
- License utilization table (with Tenant column in multi-tenant view)

## Services (`/services`)

- Per-service sparkline cards with aggregated user counts across selected tenants
- Combined multi-service comparison line chart (per-tenant series in multi-tenant view)

## Licenses & Adoption (`/licenses`)

- **Date range picker** — filter all charts and data by custom time period, with **Reset** button to restore full available range
- **Data availability indicator** — shows the actual historical data range from Graph reports (uses `ReportDate`, not collection timestamp); data accumulates beyond the 180-day Graph API limit
- **Month-over-month adoption chart** — per-service active users as % of total licenses, adapts to selected date range, Y-axis 0–100% with 2 decimal places. Chart automatically re-renders when date range changes via `@key` forcing component recreation
- **Automated recommendations** — scale up/down/monitor based on utilization thresholds and trend analysis
- **License detail table** — searchable with utilization bars and recommendation chips
- **M365 Message Center** — displays service announcements and advisories with:
  - **Multi-select filter chips** for Category and Severity (toggle on/off to combine filters)
  - **Collapsible month groups** (yyyy-MM) via expansion panels — individually expand/collapse for easy scanning of large post volumes
  - Tenant column visible in multi-tenant view
  - Inline severity color coding and "no matches" feedback

## Feature-Level Activity (`/activity`)

- **Per-workload feature breakdown** — Teams (meetings, chat messages, channel messages, calls), Exchange (emails sent/received/read), SharePoint (files viewed, files shared, page views, files synced), OneDrive (files viewed, files shared, files synced)
- **30-day activity trend charts** — one chart per workload with line series per activity type; in multi-tenant view, series are labeled `"ActivityType (TenantName)"` for per-tenant granularity
- **Activity summary table** — searchable, sortable by total count and daily average across all workloads
- Multi-tenant support — Tenant column visible when multiple tenants are selected; charts show tenant-level breakdown
- Data source: Graph Reports API (`getTeamsUserActivityCounts`, `getSharePointActivityUserCounts`, `getOneDriveActivityUserCounts`, `getEmailActivityCounts`)

## Copilot Adoption (`/copilot`)

- **KPI cards** — Total Copilot active users, total assigned licenses, overall adoption rate with color-coded thresholds
- **Per-app bar chart** — Active users across Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, OneNote, Loop, and Copilot Chat
- **Adoption detail table** — per-app breakdown with utilization progress bars and status chips (Strong/Growing/Low/Critical)
- **Automated recommendations** — actionable alerts based on adoption patterns (low app usage, overall low adoption, Chat-only usage patterns)
- Multi-tenant view — per-tenant grouped bar chart series
- Data source: Graph Beta API (`getMicrosoft365CopilotUsageUserDetail`); requires Copilot licenses

## User Segmentation (`/segmentation`)

- **Segment KPIs** — Total users, Heavy (3+ active workloads), Light (1–2 workloads), Inactive (0 workloads) with percentages
- **Distribution chart** — Donut chart in single-tenant view; switches to grouped bar chart (one series per tenant) in multi-tenant view showing Heavy/Light/Inactive side by side
- **Segment trend** — Stacked area chart tracking segment sizes over time (up to 6 months); in multi-tenant view, series are labeled per-tenant (e.g., "Heavy (Contoso)", "Inactive (Fabrikam)") for independent tracking
- **Per-tenant breakdown table** — shows waste % (inactive/total) per tenant in multi-tenant view
- **Recommendations** — license waste alerts for high inactive %, adoption maturity recognition, light-user campaign suggestions
- Data source: Graph Reports API (`getOffice365ActiveUserDetail` with D30 period); user detail is aggregated into counts, no PII stored

## Department Adoption (`/departments`)

- **KPI cards** — Departments tracked, average adoption rate, lowest-adoption department
- **Horizontal stacked bar chart** — Active vs. inactive users per department (top 20 by size)
- **Department detail table** — searchable, with adoption progress bars and status chips (High/Medium/Low)
- Multi-tenant support — Tenant column in table when multiple tenants selected
- **Minimum threshold** — departments with fewer than 5 users excluded from "lowest adoption" KPI to avoid noise
- Data source: Graph API `/users` (department field) + `getOffice365ActiveUserDetail`; requires `User.Read.All` permission

## Consumption Proxy (`/consumption`)

- **Composite consumption score** (0–100) — weighted from 4 dimensions:
  - Active User Adoption (30%) — MAU / licensed seats
  - Activity Intensity (30%) — total actions (emails, meetings, files) / active users
  - Storage Utilization (20%) — used storage / estimated allocation
  - Workload Breadth (20%) — avg services used per user (from segmentation)
- **KPI cards with month-over-month deltas** — Overall score, adoption %, total storage, avg workloads; each shows a color-coded chip indicating change vs previous month (+green / -red)
- **Export CSV** — "Export CSV" button downloads all consumption data as `/api/export/consumption` (TenantId, Score, Adoption, Storage, Workloads, Activity)
- **Per-tenant score comparison** — horizontal progress bars ranked by score
- **Radar chart** — 4-axis breakdown (Adoption, Activity, Storage, Breadth) per tenant
- **Score trend** — line chart tracking consumption score over time (up to 6 months); per-tenant series in multi-tenant view
- **Storage by service** — breakdown of SharePoint, OneDrive, Exchange storage with bars
- **Recommendations** — actionable alerts for low scores, license waste, narrow workload usage
- Data source: Computed from `getSharePointSiteUsageStorage`, `getOneDriveUsageStorage`, `getMailboxUsageStorage` + existing MAU/activity/segmentation data

## Security Services (`/security`)

- **Tenant Entra ID License Levels table** — auto-detects P1/P2/Free tier from stored license SKUs per tenant, shows which tenants can provide sign-in and MFA data
- **Sign-in activity chart** (30 days) — success vs failure area chart with axis labels and legend
- **Per-service breakdown** — Defender, Entra ID, Intune, Sentinel cards with failure rates
- **MFA adoption rate** — gauge with percentage and actionable recommendations
- **True MFA data** — uses Microsoft Graph Beta API `AuthenticationDetails` (counts non-password auth methods that succeeded). Only available from tenants with Entra ID P1/P2
- **Clear data availability notes** — explains exactly what's available per license tier and that Free-tier tenants cannot expose audit log data via Graph

## Tenant Management (`/tenants`)

- Register/deregister tenants — form auto-resets after successful registration with auto-dismissing success message
- **Inline display name editing** — pencil icon next to each tenant name opens an inline text field with save/cancel buttons; updates propagate to the global tenant selector immediately
- Admin consent URL generator with clipboard copy — redirect URI points to the Static Web App consent-complete page (configured via `ConsentCallback:RedirectUri`)
- **Collect Now button** — triggers immediate data collection for a specific tenant via the dedicated Collector container app (internal HTTP call); automatically falls back to local collection if the collector is unavailable. Collects MAU, licenses, Message Center, sign-ins, activity, Copilot, segmentation, departments, storage, M365 app usage, and consumption score
- Toggle tenant active/inactive — global tenant selector updates immediately when toggling or deleting tenants
- **Auto-refresh** — the global tenant selector polls every 30 seconds for newly registered tenants (e.g., via consent callback); new tenants are auto-selected and all dashboard pages reload data without requiring a manual browser refresh

## Automated Consent & Tenant Registration

- **Consent Complete Page** — Static Web App (`static/consent-complete/index.html`) hosted separately from the dashboard on Azure Static Web Apps (Free tier)
- **Isolation**: Customer admins are never redirected to the actual dashboard — they see only a branded static page with no access to customer-sensitive data
- **Auto-registration flow**:
  1. Tenant admin clicks the consent URL (generated from Tenants page or sent via email)
  2. Azure AD shows the permission consent prompt
  3. On approval, Azure AD redirects to the Static Web App with `?tenant={tenantId}&admin_consent=True`
  4. The static page computes an HMAC token and POSTs to the Consent Callback container (`/consent-callback`)
  5. The Consent container validates the HMAC, calls Graph API `GET /organization` to verify consent and retrieve tenant details
  6. Auto-fills: TenantId (from URL), TenantName (*.onmicrosoft.com domain), DisplayName (organization name)
  7. Upserts `TenantInfo` with `IsActive = true`
  8. Triggers initial data collection for the newly registered tenant
  9. Returns success — static page shows "Consent granted successfully" with org details
- **Security**: HMAC shared secret validation prevents unauthorized callback abuse; Graph API call verifies consent is actually granted
- **Telemetry**: Application Insights JS SDK tracks consent page views and success/failure rates
